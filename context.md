# üí° Project Title: Lyked

**Lyked** is a mobile application that empowers users to save and organize their favorite videos and images from various social media platforms ‚Äî such as TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, and Pinterest ‚Äî in a private, personalized media vault. The app gives users a clean, intuitive experience to curate content they resonate with and revisit it whenever they want.

## üß© Problem

In the age of infinite scrolling, users often come across inspiring, funny, emotional, or educational content ‚Äî only to lose it moments later. Social media apps aren‚Äôt designed for long-term media curation. Users resort to scattered bookmarks, screenshots, or saved folders that are platform-locked and difficult to manage.

---

## ‚úÖ Solution

**Lyked** gives users one unified space to:

- Collect links to favorite images and videos from across the internet.
- Categorize and tag media for easy filtering.
- View all saved content in a scrollable visual library.
- Organize content without relying on the original platforms' saved-post features.

> _Future versions will include onboard AI that learns from stored media and recommends similar videos and images from the internet ‚Äî tailoring discovery to the user's true tastes._

## üöÄ Key Features (MVP)

- **Add Media**: Paste a link to an image or video, give it a title and optional tags
- **Categorized Media Feed**: Browse saved content by type (e.g., memes, style, inspiration)
