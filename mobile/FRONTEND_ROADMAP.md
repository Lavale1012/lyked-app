# ðŸ“± Lyked Frontend Roadmap

## Current State Analysis

### âœ… What's Working
- Basic React Native + Expo setup with NativeWind styling
- Tab navigation structure with 4 main screens
- HomeScreen partially implemented with LinkPreview API integration
- LykedCard component for displaying media items
- Basic UserContext (hardcoded UUID)
- FlatList rendering with responsive card layout

### ðŸš§ Current Issues & Limitations
- UserContext uses hardcoded UUID instead of real authentication
- CreateLykedScreen and FolderScreen are placeholder components
- No error boundary implementation in App.tsx (mentioned but not implemented)
- API calls hardcoded to localhost:8080 instead of environment variables
- LinkPreview API key exposed in code instead of environment variables
- No loading states or offline handling
- Missing form validation and user feedback
